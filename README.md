# 🌍 **geodecodo**📍
geodecodo is a microservice { 📦} built on top of open source project **Pelias** for providing geocoding and reverse geocoding translation services.


## Build Status
Still Under development


## Introduction
#### The problem first
This idea came to our mind when we tried to find an API ready-made system that can provide us with a geo-decoder service for human-readable addresses, but all of them were based on paid subscription (could cost a lot of money for highly used applications), therefore we've started to look for a geographical map provider service/application that can provide this information for us as an open-source project in order to build up the API layer as a service wrapper accordingly.

#### Solution
 **Pelias** was found as an open-source project for map and geocoder provider.
 

Add always digital footprint for the solution developed in github for making tracking and know the history of the application is reachable and well known for developers as a journey
