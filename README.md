# 🌍 **geodecodo**📍
geodecodo is a microservice { 📦} built on top of open source project **Pelias** for providing geocoding and reverse geocoding translation services.
___

## It's Part of Public Support Services Collection 
#### This collection aims to provide multiple services ready to be connected to or consumed by any system that is intended to help face natural disasters and current digital health challenges.
#### Usually, those kinds of systems require specific functionalities like geocoder services, in which it requires time to build with significant cost to be spent on this matter from relevant service providers.
#### Hence, this collection will be the bridge between other open-source projects -that provide useful information and required services- with the new solutions ideas to support this cause while speeding up the development and go to the production process.
##### *"Inspired By Call for Code & IBM Code and Response Initiatives"*
##### *We all love open source and as we are trying to build a better place through the use of emerging technologies.*
